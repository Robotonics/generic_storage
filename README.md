Generic partition and filesystem hooks for Arduino

<pre>
Currently supports FAT 16/32, and long filenames.

Built-in support for USB shield from http://www.circuitsathome.com
See https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0 for drivers.

NOTE: The USB host driver SHOULD BE 100% compatable with all devices.
USB thumb drives, card readers, ATA bridges, and SATA bridges are all knownd to work.
