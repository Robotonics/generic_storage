Generic partition and filesystem hooks for Arduino

<pre>
Currently supports FAT 16/32, and long filenames.

Built-in support for USB shield from <A HREF="http://www.circuitsathome.com">Circuits at Home</A>
See <A HREF="https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0">https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield_2.0</A> for drivers.

NOTE: The USB host driver SHOULD BE 100% compatable with all devices supporting BULK STORAGE.
      USB thumb drives, card readers, ATA bridges, and SATA bridges are all known to work.
