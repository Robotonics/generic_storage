/*
 * Notes:
 * Read and Write do not care about sector counts, or how many to read.
 * The passed method needs to just read and write one full sector.
 * Reads and Writes are for multiple sectors.
 *
 * In order to assist these calls, a pointer to the Storage struct is also passed,
 * so that your driver can get at its own private information, if used.
 * The private_data pointer can point to anything that you need for your driver,
 * or nothing at all if you do not need any. Nothing in the code here will use it.
 *
 * Also, "sector" is the Logical Block Address on the media, starting at ZERO.
 * C/H/S is not, and will not be used!
 * Any translations from the LBA must be done on the storage driver side, if needed.
 * Translations include any sector offsets, logical device numbers, etc.
 * The buffer size is guaranteed to be correct providing that you set SectorSize properly.
 *
 * Success from Read and Write should return ZERO,
 * Errors should return a non-Zero integer meaningful to the storage caller.
 * Negative One is returned by this layer to indicate some other error.
 *
